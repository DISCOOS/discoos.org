# Privacy Policy

Effective date: July 16, 2025

RingDrill ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. 
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect 
any information you provide when using the RingDrill mobile application.

By using RingDrill, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this policy. 
Should you not agree with any portion of this policy, we recommend refraining from 
using the app further and contacting our support team for clarification.

## 1. Information We Collect

Our commitment to your privacy is fundamental, and we want to transparently explain 
how we handle the data you provide when using our services. This includes the types 
of data we collect, how it is processed, stored, and how you can control it.

### Anonymous Data
We may collect certain data that cannot identify you personally by itself. 
This data is used for debugging and performance improvement purposes. 
Specifically, this information may include:

- Device type and operating system (e.g., Android or iOS version)
- General usage statistics (e.g., session duration) which do not contain any sensitive information
- Error logs from application crashes (if you provide consent)

We may also store the following **locally on your device**:
- Drill configurations (e.g., station count, duration)
- Locally generated schedules and team assignments

No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.

### Personal Data
No personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected unless explicitly
requested and agreed upon by you. Hence, the RingDrill app does not request access to, 
nor does it track personal identifying information without consent. In most cases, 
we collect data outlined under anonymous data on an **opt-in** basis.

## Analytics and Crash Reporting

We use analytics and crash reporting tools to improve the stability, 
performance, and overall user experience of our app.

### Use of Sentry for Diagnostics

As part of this effort, we use a third-party service, **Sentry**,
to collect, track, and analyze application errors and performance issues.

#### What Data Is Collected by Sentry?

When analytics and crash reporting are enabled, Sentry may collect 
**limited technical data** to help us identify and resolve technical 
issues. This data includes:

- **Technical Information**:
    - Device model (e.g., iPhone 12, Samsung S21)
    - Operating system version (e.g., iOS 17, Android 14)
    - App version (e.g., 1.0.3)
    - Screen size and resolution
- **Crash Information**:
    - Error logs (stack traces, exception messages)
    - App performance metrics (e.g., response times, memory usage)
- **Network Information**:
    - IP address (temporarily used by Sentry for deduplication purposes; not stored permanently)
- **User Behavior** (Optional):
    - In-app navigation and interactions (collected only as part of performance monitoring, when consented).

**Note**: Sentry does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) unless 
explicitly configured to do so. The RingDrill app will only use Sentry when you have 
explicitly given your consent. In our implementation, **all data collected is linked to your 
device, not your identity**.

## 2. Use of Information

The data collected with Sentry is solely used for:
- Diagnosing and fixing app errors or crashes.
- Monitoring app release stability across various devices.
- Improving app responsiveness, performance, and usage experience.

All data collected by Sentry is processed through their platform. 
For further details, read Sentry's [Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

The data entered by users and stored in RingDrill is used solely to:
- Support the planning and execution of training drills
- Display the relevant drill information to users based on their role (e.g., team member or coordinator)

## First-Time Consent for Analytics

To respect your privacy:
1. When you first use the app, you will be explicitly prompted to provide **active consent** for analytics and crash reporting.
2. Until consent is provided, RingDrill will treat analytics as **disabled by default**, meaning no data will be communicated to Sentry or any analytics endpoint.

## Your Control Over Analytics

We provide full control over enabling or disabling analytics and crash reporting:
1. Navigate to the app's **Settings Page**.
2. Use the toggle for **App Analytics Consent** to explicitly enable or disable analytics and crash reporting.
3. If analytics is disabled, all in-app analytics and crash reporting will stop immediately.

## 3. Data Security and Retention

We prioritize protecting all user data collected through RingDrill, regardless of its type 
(opted-in analytics or app interactions). Our team adheres to industry-standard security measures 
like secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to ensure data integrity between the app and 
external services such as Sentry.

All data entered by the user is stored locally on your device. We do not track you or your usage 
across the internet. If you delete the app, all your stored data will also be deleted. 

Raw analytics data is retained temporarily **for up to 90 days** and then securely
deleted in accordance with Sentry's data governance policies.

## 4. Children's Privacy

RingDrill is intended for use by professionals and is not designed for children under 13.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

From time to time, we may need to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the app, 
comply with legal requirements, or incorporate new features. We will notify all users of 
significant updates via in-app notifications and provide a summary of changes.

This policy is effective as of 2025-07-15
